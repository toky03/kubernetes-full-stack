\subsection{Database}
In the further sections we will use a plain mysql docker container as a database. In order to use the Application completely locally, a local mySQL database has to be installed and a schema for the random generator application needs to be provided for a specific randgenuser.
If there is not yet a local mySQL database installed it can be done with the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
\end{lstlisting}
After the installation log in to MySQL as root. 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
sudo mysql
\end{lstlisting}
Now the Database and the user can be created and permissions to the respective schema will be given.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
CREATE database db_example;
CREATE USER 'springuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY ThePassword;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.db_example TO 'springuser'@'localhost';
\end{lstlisting}
With this, the Database is ready to used by the Random Generator Example from localhost.
