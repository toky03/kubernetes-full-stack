\subsection{Model}
The Following Picture should give an overview about the different Services and how they work with each other.

\begin{tikzpicture}
\node (A) at (0,0) [ellipse, draw] {Random Generator};
\node (B) at (5,-3) [ellipse, draw] {Statistic Service};
\node (C) at (6,-1) [circle, draw] {Database};
\node (D) at (9,0) [ellipse, draw] {Frontend};
\node (E) at (5,1) [ellipse, draw] {Middle Tier};

\draw[<->, thick] (B) to[bend left=20] (C);
\draw[->, thick] (B) to[bend right=20] (D);
\draw[->, thick] (A) to[bend left=10] (E);
\draw[->, thick] (E) to[bend right=10] (D); 
\draw[<->, thick] (E) to[bend left=10] (C);

\end{tikzpicture}
The random generator service creates a JSON file with an unique id and a random number. The middle tier service calls the random generator, saves the number with the id, saves it in the database and forwards it to the frontend.
The statistic service is fetched from the frontend to deliver historic data for the graph and the table with all counts from previous calls.
