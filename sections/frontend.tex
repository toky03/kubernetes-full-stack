The frontend Application is build with Spring Boot and 

Creating Spring Boot Application:
\begin{tabbing}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
Project & Maven Project \\
Language & Java \\
Spring Boot & 2.1.3 (All versions would apply) \\
Group & ch.toky.randgen \\
Artifact & frontend \\
Name & Frontend \\
Description & Frontend Service \\
Packaging & Jar \\
Java Version & 8 \\
Dependencies & Web, Rest Repositories
\end{tabular}
\end{tabbing}

As we now only have the controller part of our User interface with the Spring boot application, we now need to create the Angular part.

therefore we create a new Project directly with Angular CLI within the folder where all the other Projects are stored.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
ng new ui-frontend
\end{lstlisting}

Now we can try if the project has been set up correctly with navigating to the new project folder and hit ng serve.
Once the server is ready we should be able to access localhost:4200 and see a sample home page made by angular cli.

As the frontend should be only one singe application we will now move all folders into the Spring boot application.

in the Folder where all Projects are stored we execute those commands.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Bash]
mv ui-frontend/src/* frontend/src/
rm -rf ui-frontend/src/
mv ui-frontend/* frontend/
rm -rf ui-frontend
\end{lstlisting}

In order to serve all the Frontend files from the Spring Boot application we need to tell angular to save all compiled files into the target/classes/static folder.
Therefore we need to change the output path option in the file angular.json
